Geochart GeoJSON
================

Create charts very similar to the [Google Charts geochart](https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery/geochart), but with GeoJSON support.

The Google Charts geochart is a very interesting project. However, it only generates predetermined maps (countries of the world, countries of a continent, states of a country). Althought there is possible to generate high resolution maps (cities of a state or metros of a city), these maps are only available for some specific USA regions.

This project makes possible to draw geocharts in custom and high resolution maps thought GeoJSON.

The above printscreen shows a Geochart GeoJSON in the Rio de Janeiro state, in Brazil.
